\section{Team Meeting Plan}

The team will be meeting in person on a weekly basis in a library at McMaster University. The time of the meetings
needs to be adjusted in order to accommodate all the members' time constraints.
Additional virtual meetings may be required when approaching a deliverable deadline.\\
Industry supervisor meetings will be held virtually on a biweekly or as needed basis. \\

Matthew H. will be in charge of the agenda. The rest of the team will be recording meeting minutes interchangeably. All members will be encouraged
to chair meetings throughout the duration of the project. 

\section{Team Communication Plan}

Our team communication plan will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Issues: GitHub/GitHub Projects
  \item Weekly Meetings: In-person on campus
  \item Meetings outside the weekly meetings: Teams
  \item Meeting minutes: GitHub
  \item Meetings with stakeholders: Zoom
  \item Project discussion (asynchronous): Teams
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?

  We will primarily be using GitHub for managing the project files. \\
Each team member has their individual branches on which they will engage with. 
The member should open a pull request after completion of their assigned task. If 
multiple members are collaborating on the same task, they will use either member's branch. Once completed, 
a pull request can be opened which will be reviewed by the other team members. \\

Issues that focus on a single aspect of the project may be opened and will combine
all relevant items. Sub-issues can be used if additional refinement is needed. \\

\textbf{Overall Workflow Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Issue Creation: For each deliverable, an issue will be opened to divide the respective sections and keep track of assigned tasks.
 As mentioned above, sub-issues will be used if additional refinement or breakdown of work is needed.
 \item Branching: Each team member will create a dedicated branch for themselves to work on their respective tasks. If multiple members
 collaborate on the same task, they will work within either member’s branch to avoid merge conflicts.
 \item Checklist: As each member is working through their respective sections, they will keep track of the checklist in our repository.
 Once a specific task is complete, the member will check off the associated item.
 \item Commit Process: All changes will be regularly committed to the respective branches.
 \item Pull Requests (PRs): Once any issues have been resolved, a pull request on GitHub will be created. Changes must be reviewed for
 any merge conflicts before merging to the main branch.
 \item Team member review: Another team member will review the PR against the rubric and provide feedback through comments. The author
 of the section should respond or implement any feedback provided by the member who reviewed the submission.
 \item Merging: Once the PR has been reviewed, approved, and confirmed that all of the rubric criteria has been met, it will successfully
 be merged into the main branch.
\end{enumerate}




 \item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
 classification, etc.?


\textbf{Issue management:}
We will be using GitHub Issues to keep track of the following items: tasks, meetings, attendance, etc. GitHub Issues will be used as a project log (i.e. attendance, meeting minutes or code review) as well as a tracker (i.e. deliverables, bugs, enhancements).


There are template issues readily available from our professor, as shown below, and we will be using these throughout our capstone. \\


\textbf{Issue Templates Available:}
Lectures: Used to track team details during lectures (i.e. important notes, attendance)
Peer Review: Individuals outside of the team review one of our items
Supervisor Meeting: Agenda template for meetings with supervisors/stakeholders
TA Meeting: Agenda template for meetings with TA
Team Meeting: Agenda template for weekly meetings with our team
Blank Issue: Blank template to be used to create a new issue \\


\textbf{Issue Labels Classification:}


There are a set of labels in GitHub Issues that we can use when creating issues to organize them accordingly. Some of the labels we may use can be seen below with a description of when they may be used:
Bug: Used for issues that indicate unexpected behaviour and require correction.
Lecture: Used for lecture-related tasks/issues.
TA Meeting: Used for issues that include meeting notes, feedback and actions from TA sessions.
Team Meeting: Used for issues where team meeting discussions are noted.
Supervisor Meeting: Used for issues related to the project supervisor, including follow-ups from discussions.
Documentation/Deliverable: Used for issues corresponding to any work related sections of the deliverables.


 \item Use of CI/CD


 We will be using GitHub Actions as our CI/CD platform to ensure that all of our documentation and project files are being built,
formatted, and reviewed properly before they are merged into the main branch of the project. Workflows which are defined in the
YAML files will essentially trigger the workflows to run automatically on pushes and pull requests. Each run compiles the LaTeX
document, checks formatting and structure, and lastly, also compiles a PDF with the latest changes. To ensure consistency across
all files, merges require both teammate approval and passing CI checks. This forces errors to be caught early and also reinforces
us as a team to follow industry-standard practices. Implementing these practices throughout the entire project will aid in
achieving a consistent, polished and coherent final product and documentation.


 \end{itemize}


\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}


\begin{itemize}
 \item How will you be using GitHub projects? \\
Our team will be using GitHub Projects to keep track of and manage our tasks and deliverables. The board will be following a
Kanban style where all issues will be presented by cards on the board and they will be moved across the board across various
columns. The columns listed across the board will be as follows: Backlog $\rightarrow$ Ready $\rightarrow$ In Progress $\rightarrow$
In Review $\rightarrow$ Done. There will
also be custom fields set that you will see across the board which will be listed as: Milestone (M1 to M6), Type (task, meeting,
bug, doc), Priority (High/Medium/Low), Assignee/Team Member, Deadline. All in all, each card will be linked to specific issues,
milestones as well as fields to ensure we stay on track with the overall Capstone Schedule. \\


Our big picture schedule follows the timeline and deadlines listed in the course outline. The deliverables outlined in the course
outline have been grouped into six milestones (M1 to M6) for organizational purposes. These milestones align with major phases of the
course and we have grouped them together based on similar timelines and tasks. The milestones mentioned above represent the
following deliverables, listed below:


 \begin{itemize}
   \item M1 (Weeks 3 to 4): Problem Statement, Proof of Concept (POC) Plan, Development Plan, Team Charter
   \item M2 (Weeks 5 to 6): Requirements Document (SRS) Revision 0, Hazard Analysis Revision 0, Design Document Revision -1
   \item M3 (Week 7): Verification \& Validation (V\&V) Plan Revision 0
   \item M4 (Weeks 8 to 9): Integrated Draft Document (Problem Statement, SRS, Hazard Analysis, V\&V Plan), Peer Reviews (whole document), Update draft with feedback
   \item M5 (Weeks 10 to 12): Proof of Concept Demonstration (document + results), Design Document Revision 0, V\&V Report Revision 0, Refinement of SRS, Hazard Analysis, and V\&V Plan based on results and feedback
   \item M6 (End of Term): Final Demonstration - Revision 1, EXPO Demonstration, Final Documentation Revision 1 (including Problem Statement, Development Plan, POC Plan, Requirements Document, Hazard Analysis, Design Document, V\&V Plan, V\&V Report, Extra Documentation 1, Extra Documentation 2 and Source Code)
 \end{itemize}




 \item Include a link to your GitHub project


 \textbf{GitHub Project Link:} \url{https://github.com/users/M9Huynh/projects/2/views/1}


\end{itemize}


\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}


\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

The application will follow the steps below (high-level):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A user will record them performing a physio exercise (decide on body part?)
  \item Determine if the exercise is “good” form or “bad” form based on requirements from the stakeholders
  \item From the analysis, the application will provide guidance to improve the efficacy of the exercise
\end{enumerate}


Some potential risks from this process flow are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Variations in how different users will record each video.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Having a guide overlay to indicate where they should film the exercise from.
  \end{itemize}  
  \item Inaccuracies with depth or monitoring a 3D motion on a 2D plane
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Prompting the user to also perform the exercise from another angle and then analyzing two different recordings.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Hardware limitations - as the application would be easiest to use on a phone due to the camera already being on there, it may have limitations when processing the footage.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using a lightweight solution to process the recording to reduce lag.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Accuracy in the footage may be different in a non-controlled environment and lead to inaccurate assessment of the exercise. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A demonstration can consist of seeing if we are able to obtain the same feedback in different light levels/clothing to see if it will affect our input data.
  \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Maham} \\
Having a plan eliminates a lot of uncertainty, whether it is timeline, team roles or conflict resolution methodologies. It allows the team to focus on what is important without being bogged down by frivolous details. Plus, it allows effective allocation of resources. For example, if one person is better at front end development, members who do not want to be or cannot be involved in it, do not have to start from scratch and master a new skill within a small time frame. 

The main advantage of CI/CD is a smoother integration of code while reducing the amount of mistakes and code conflicts that would need to be fixed at the end of the project. However, there is one troublesome disadvantage - conflicting merge requests (this is in the context of using github) and the very time consuming endeavour of fixing them. 

As for group disagreements, I do not think we had any. All members carefully listened to any input from their teammates and implemented any changes that were deemed to be beneficial. We were professional and respectful of each other’s opinions and gave equal importance to everyone’s feedback. \\


\textbf{Matthew}\\
I think it is important to create a development plan prior to starting the project because it helps our team navigate conflict down the line. Not everyone works the same and so this development plan acts as a formal document to communicate with the team and find common ground for everyone to perform well on. Furthermore, it is a form of having an awkward conversation now compared to down the line when this work wasn't done and there is no basis to critique a member's performance. 

An advantage of CI/CD is the reduced manual effort to test and evaluate code. If there is a problem with one of our documents that we upload or a file that is incorrect, we can have the tests evaluate it and be flagged for issues with it. A downside of CI/CD is the overhead or the amount of time that it takes to set up. For a shorter project it will take a bit longer to set up and thus less time is put towards coding the features at the cost of automating the building and testing.

The group did not have any disagreements during this deliverable. Everyone was able to communicate to each other and each meeting went with a plan and left with actionable items to complete. As the term gets busier and there are more deliverables for other classes I think that the team charter below will help guide us for the rest of the project. \\

\noindent \textbf{Vaisnavi} \\
Creating a development plan before starting the project is extremely important as it allows us to map out all of our ideas and thoughts. As someone who is a visual learner, I have to see all the tasks written out before I start anything. Writing out a plan has always been something that aided me in successfully completing any task. Ultimately having a plan helps as it allows you to take a step back and see the entire picture and be able to map out every little thing in order to reach the final product.


One of the main advantages of CI/CD is the fact that it is able to provide us with quick feedback. It directs our attention to a merge conflict from a PR right away, which allows us to eliminate that error immediately without it breaking our main branch. On the other hand, one of the main disadvantages is that although it does catch errors, sometimes there could be false positives in terms of if there is a simple formatting issue but the actual syntax and document is perfectly fine. This ultimately will harm us in terms of efficiency as it will hinder our progress if we are trying to find a bug that does not exist.


No disagreements took place within this deliverable, everyone on the team was able to voice their concerns. All team members have been respectful and have been taking in the feedback and applying it. With that being said, we have had some suggestions come into play, specifically with our respective branches. We started off by having branches for each document we were working on, but we decided that it would be easier to keep track of each member having just one branch for their version of the document and from their multiple PR’s could be reviewed and approved. We discussed this during a team meeting and quickly came to this resolution, which showcases how key of a role communication plays in a team setting.

\textbf{Eman}\\

Before starting a project, it is essential to create a development plan because it gives the team a clear path forward. In my personal experience, it helps in assigning duties, defining the scope, outlining deliverables, and setting reasonable deadlines. Brainstorming a plan allows us to save wasted effort and lower risks by recognizing problems in the early stages of our project by narrowing down our scope. Additionally, it provides a way to make sure that everyone is on board with the project's objectives. 

Faster development, early problem detection, and consistent code quality are some of the primary benefits of CI/CD. In this method, testing and deployment save time and push the release of updates faster. Although it is relatively time. A downside to CI/CD would be that frequent releases can be problematic if not handled properly, but generally speaking, the advantages exceed the disadvantages.

The team members were respectful and professional in our first few conversations and meetings together. Everyone has had the chance to equally voice their opinion or thoughts and be taken into consideration. That being said, there were a few differences in preference for the focus of the project. While some members were leaning toward one project idea, others including myself were striving to choose another project idea. While both project ideas are meaningful and have potential, the group decided to put it to a vote. While my choice of project wasn’t favored by the majority, I was willing to take on my team member’s choice of project and everyone was very professional about it. \\

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\wss{borrows from
\href{https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf}
{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}

Our group's primary goal is to create a project that we are proud to have our names
on, can be talked about in interviews and to peers. It is important for us to build 
a solution to our problem statement while also adhering to code quality such as 
readability and documentation. Through this, we seek to develop our technical skills 
through tackling a real world problem. Additionally, we are also aiming for above-average 
grades as a secondary goal. 

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

Our team expects full attendance to meetings scheduled in advance for the entire duration 
of the meeting. If a member cannot attend a meeting or is going to miss a portion of the meeting, 
they must communicate it in advance to the team and catch-up on the missed portion of the meeting 
(i.e. meeting minutes). Missing 3 meetings in a row when a deliverable is not the main point of 
discussion will trigger a meeting with the rest of the team. Moreover, if a deliverable is the 
main topic, 2 missed meetings will be the limit. These standards are for non-emergency situations. 
For emergencies, see below. 

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

Acceptable excuses include: Academic sessions (classes, tutorials), academic requirements (due-dates
prior to the capstone deliverable) and medical appointments. An advance notice for medical 
appointments will be appreciated. It is the responsibility of the missing member to make up for a 
missed meeting. Repeated excuses will not be acceptable; please refer to attendance expectations. 
Please see below for emergency cases.

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

In the event of an emergency case, the team member should contact the team. Extended cases of 
emergency (more than 2 weeks or time taken off that impedes deliverables) should be brought to 
the attention of the teaching staff to ensure the work load is manageable for the rest of the team.

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

In order to maintain consistent quality for deliverables, each weekly meeting will briefly go over 
deliverable expectations. Each deliverable should be checked against the rubric [on avenue] and also 
against the repository checklist by the individual that wrote that deliverable but also by a teammate. 


Furthermore, for meetings, team members are expected to arrive, review relevant material and provide 
any problems or status updates with their work to ensure the meeting stays on-topic and productive.

Lastly, during weekly meetings we will discuss “what went well, what to change” to see if there is a 
way to streamline communication to attain this quality. We also encourage each team member to ask for 
help in our informal chat in a timely manner while being respectful of each person's time.


\subsubsection*{Attitude}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}

For this project, the expected attitude from group members is to stay positive, respectful, and collaborative. Everyone should contribute their fair share, communicate openly, and be willing to listen to each other’s ideas. Mistakes and challenges will come up, but approaching them with patience and a problem-solving mindset will keep the group moving forward smoothly.

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

To stay on track, we plan to use a project management tool like Jira to assign tickets and organize tasks for each group member. This will help us clearly see who is responsible for what, monitor progress in real time, and make sure deadlines are being met. By breaking down the work into smaller tasks and tracking them, we can stay organized, avoid confusion, and keep the project moving steadily toward completion. We can also measure each task and its success by breaking it down into smaller tasks. That way we can measure whether a group member has completed a task, or only 75 percent completed a task. 
\wss{What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team
ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team
performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage
members whose performance is below expectations?  What are the consequences for
someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

The team will engage in social activities together if schedules allow. Team building activities will strongly be encouraged. There may be sessions of working together in person and spending some time together with any member that is available. This will also depend on work habits and preferences.

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

When making a decision on the team, we will lean towards a unanimous vote. We 
want each member of the team to feel their feedback is heard to improve the project 
communication. In cases where this is not the case, we will hold a vote. Since there 
are 5 members, no one can abstain that way a solution can be achieved. 


Each member is allowed to voice their opinion to the team without interruption so 
everyone is heard and we can reach an objective solution (without personal feelings 
swaying the decision). 


In the event that voting cannot be held properly, we will select a neutral mediator to 
guide us further.
