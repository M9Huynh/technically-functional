\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}

From the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors study performed in 2019, 
individuals that would benefit from physical rehabilitation at least once in their 
lifetime is upwards of 2.41 billion globally \citep{CiezaEtAl2021}.
Furthermore, a study indicating the perception of access to physiotherapy based on 
socio-demographic factors yielded that approximately 1 in 4 participants 
felt they had limited access to physiotherapy as a results of cost, wait-times or 
location \citep{BathEtAl2016}. Those with access to a physiotherapist experienced a 
disconnect with performing a movement with proper time-under-tension (TUT) and 
correct form \citep{FaberEtAl2015}. While a physiotherapist can advise these individuals
during assessment and proceeding follow-up appointments, the efficacy of rehabilitation
depends heavily on the individual. In turn, this creates a need for a tool that helps users 
adjust exercise form unsupervised. This project aims to develop a tool that can 
provides feedback and correction during physical rehabilitation exercise.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\textbf{Inputs:} A recording of the user performing their physical rehabilitation exercise, captured through a smartphone, webcam, or any other device. \\
\textbf{Outputs:} Feedback or corrections of the demonstrated movement, along with highlighting targeted adjustments to the form as needed.

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

    In terms of what went well throughoutwriting this deliverable we were mainly 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
